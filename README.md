Random quick tools i have made for myself.

Tools list:

Windows:
                
    CopyToPi -  copy the .py script into a directory with contents that you would like to
                copy to a raspberry pi wirelessly on the same network using the scp command.

    ADB_send -  a super basic tool to send files over via androids SDK using the adb push command, the tool has a super basic
                basic GUI with not much functionality, you can choose the file, and change the IP adress and path to send
                the Android phone needs to be set to Developer mode and it must have connect once via USB to the PC for this to work

    DesktopSort - This tool keeps my Desktop clean, it runs once a week, 
                  it comes with a config file where you can add your directories and sort the extensions to the relative directories
                  
    Docx_WordSearch - This tool crawls through all directories and subdirectories and searches for givben keywords in a Word .docx document for specific keywords, 
                      if it found all keywords it creates a directory and creates
                      a shortcut to the document, if not all keywords found, it will then show the name of the documents it found the keywords in.
