These tools copies all the files from DJI flash, into a new directory on the 
Desktop and then converts all the videos into a lowres version with the 
same naming, this helps to speed up editing with after affects

Need ffmpeg installed in path env to work - https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows

soon il make this into one .py file for both dji and goprop, for now i needed something quick and dirty.
